The Infection Monkey exploiters are all built in a similar fashion inheriting from the `HostExploiter`. This class exposes two interface functions:

* `is_os_supported` - Returns a boolean value on whether the victim is supported by the exploiter (for example, returning False on Windows victims for the `SSHExploiter`). This can be sub classed and check the victim more thoroughly, for example checking for open services matching specific versions.
* `exploit_host` - Exploits the host, returning a boolean value on success.

A good example of an exploiter is the [`SSHExploiter`](https://github.com/guardicore/monkey/blob/master/monkey/infection_monkey/exploit/sshexec.py) class.

# Adding a new exploiter

Adding a new exploiter involves 3 steps:

1. Adding a new class subclassing [`HostExploiter`](https://github.com/guardicore/monkey/blob/master/monkey/infection_monkey/exploit/__init__.py) under the exploit directory and adding an import line under [`__init__.py`](https://github.com/guardicore/monkey/blob/master/monkey/infection_monkey/exploit/__init__.py)
2. Updating the configuration values in [`example.conf`](https://github.com/guardicore/monkey/blob/master/monkey/infection_monkey/example.conf) to add references to the new class. At this point, the Monkey knows how to use the new exploiter but to make it easy to use, the UI needs to be updated.
3. The relevant UI file is [`config.py`](https://github.com/guardicore/monkey/blob/master/monkey/monkey_island/cc/services/config.py) (not to be confused with the prior `config.py`) under the field `exploits`.
